            You wake up in a white hallway. The air conditioning is cold, and the fluorescent lights buzz softly above you. It feels familiar, but you don't know why.

            You don't remember who you are, where you are, and have no idea why you're here.

            In front of you, there's a door. To the right, a quiet clicking sound. A slot in the wall spits out a piece of paper.

            The first line reads: 
            
            'Dear Applicant N74320A, Congratulations!'

                HORIZON SYSTEMS ORIENTATION DOCUMENT #274
                
                Dear Applicant N74320A, congratulations!
                
                You have been selected for a prestigious role in cutting-edge AI research. Your skills and cognitive profile set you apart, making you an essential part of our mission to reshape the future of intelligence.

                You are now at the entrance to the Orientation Chamber, where you will progress through seven chapters designed to refine your knowledge and identity.

                Each chapter of your orientation contains multiple Memory Points, designed to help reconstruct and refine your personal and intellectual identity. These memory flashes will feel real because, in a way, they are.

                Your task is simple: Choose the memory that feels the most important to you.

                Trust your instincts. Follow what feels true.

                To ensure seamless integration, your Neuro-Interface has been installed, allowing you to fully engage with Horizon Systems' Memory Augmentation Protocol. Any initial disorientation is expected, do not be alarmed.
                
                At the completion of the seven chapters, you will be prepared to embark on the next phase of your journey with Horizon Systems.

            You step into the final chamber. The air feels heavier here, like the room has been here for an eternity.

            A soft chime echoes through the room. The fluorescent glow above you pulses in slow, rhythmic waves—calming, deliberate. A quiet beep. A automated voice announces: 'Orientation Complete.'
            
            You try to piece it all together... the memories, the shifting places, the overwhelming emotions. But the more you think about them, the less they make sense. Some moments feel real. Others, like fragments of someone else's life. You remember walking through icy streets, the sting of snow against your skin. But you also recall humid air, neon lights reflecting off rain-soaked pavement. Both are real. Both are impossible. You remember people. Faces, conversations, moments of warmth. But some of them… don't belong. It feels like waking from a dream, only to realize you're still inside one.

            Something isn't right...

            Your thoughts are interrupted by another beep. A letter slowly slides out of a slot in the wall: <a href="#" id="viewCompletionLink">[View Completion Notice]</a>

            <!--You think back of the memories you've been through just now. The mismatched memories, the shifting locations, the overwhelming emotions. Something isn't right. Some of the memories feel foreign, and the whole experience make you feel like you are in and out of states of dream and reality. -->
             <!-- You feel… different. Lighter. As if something has been taken from you. Or maybe you simply left it behind. -->

                You have successfully completed the Project Eidolon Orientation Program and are now fully integrated into Horizon Systems. Your dedication, adaptability, and cognitive alignment have demonstrated your readiness to embark on the next phase of this groundbreaking initiative.

                As a result of your participation, your mental and emotional frameworks have been optimized, ensuring peak performance and seamless collaboration within our research division. The temporary cognitive realignment process has now concluded, allowing for a fully stabilized identity within the Horizon Systems framework.

                Final Instructions
                	•	Please ensure full compliance with internal confidentiality protocols at all times.
                	•	Any lingering discrepancies in memory recall should be disregarded, as they are a standard effect of cognitive adaptation.
                	•	Your assigned directives will be provided upon your next system synchronization.

                Your Journey Begins Now

                The future of intelligence depends on pioneers like you. You have been chosen. You have been refined. You are ready.

                Proceed to your next phase when ready.

                Welcome to Horizon Systems.

            You stare at the letter, fingers resting on the paper's smooth, synthetic texture. The words feel cold, impersonal... like they were never really meant for you. Something about this doesn't feel right.

            You try to recall the moment you arrived here, but nothing comes. Just fragments. Fluorescent lights. The distant hum of air conditioning. A pulse of déjà vu grips you. You've stood here before. You're certain of it. But how many times?

            The screen on the far wall flickers, lines of text shifting under its surface. A notification appears:

            › Orientation Complete. Please take the user experience survey.
            <!-- todo: add survey link-->
            You click on the survey, and it shows a list of 45 questions.

            Ugh, anthor useless tedious survey that no one will read. Your gaze shifts to the exit. The door stands slightly ajar, the sterile white hallway beyond it stretching into uncertainty.

            Something tells you there won't be a second chance.

            <a href="#" id="investigateLink"> ➡Take the survey. (See if there's anything hidden.)</a>
