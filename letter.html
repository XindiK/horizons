        <h2>A Division of [REDACTED]</h2>

        <p>Dear Applicant N74320A,</p>

        <h2>Welcome to Project Eidolon</h2>

        <p>Congratulations! You have been selected for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in one of the most advanced research initiatives of the modern era. Your ingenuity, adaptability, and unique cognitive profile have placed you among a highly elite group entrusted with shaping the future of intelligence itself.</p>

        <h2>Orientation & Memory Alignment</h2>

        <p>You are currently standing at the entrance to the Orientation Chamber, the first step in your seven-chapter journey of knowledge, discovery, and transformation. Upon successful completion, you will be fully integrated into Horizon Systems, where you will contribute to groundbreaking advancements in cognitive engineering and artificial intelligence development.</p>

        <p>Some aspects of your memory may feel uncertain—this is expected. To ensure an optimal onboarding process, you have been safely synchronized with Horizon Systems’ proprietary Neuro-Interface Technology. This enhancement temporarily realigns your cognitive state to facilitate deeper learning, higher adaptability, and seamless participation in Project Eidolon.</p>

        <p><strong>You may experience mild disorientation at first. This is normal. Do not be alarmed.</strong></p>

        <h2>Memory Guiding & Your Personal Development</h2>

        <p>Each chapter of your orientation contains multiple Memory Points, designed to help reconstruct and refine your personal and intellectual identity. These memory flashes will feel real because, in a way, they are.</p>

        <p><strong>Your task is simple:</strong> Choose the memory that feels the most important to you.</p>

        <p>Trust your instincts. Follow what feels true.</p>

        <p>This process allows you to engage with the most meaningful aspects of your personal journey, ensuring that your psychological profile is optimized for the critical work ahead. As our research has confirmed, what we remember defines who we become.</p>

        <h2>The Path Forward</h2>

        <p>At the completion of the seven chapters, you will have successfully realigned with your purpose and will be prepared to embark on the next phase of your journey with Horizon Systems.</p>

        <p>At that time, you will feel complete, confident, and ready—because this is where you were always meant to be.</p>

        <p><em>Your future has already begun.</em></p>
