git s# Horizon System Backstory

## Setting: Near Future, 100 Years from Now
In this world, memories can be injected into a person to induce different mental states. A powerful tech conglomerate has developed a system that harvests these induced states to train AI models to be more human-like. The process involves immersing individuals in controlled environments where artificial memories manipulate their emotions and psychological responses.

## The World: Society, Technology, and Power
The world outside the experiment is a stark contrast to the controlled environment of the maze. Society is dominated by hyper-corporate governance, where technological advancements dictate daily life. The conglomerate overseeing the experiment is one of the most influential entities, its reach extending into policy-making, security, and even private memory markets. Memory manipulation is not widely known to the public, but rumors circulate about people experiencing moments of déjà vu, unexplainable gaps in recollection, and artificial nostalgia for events that never happened.

### **Motivations of the Conglomerate**
The official narrative of the program claims that AI must develop genuine human emotions to advance ethical decision-making, creativity, and complex problem-solving. However, the underlying truth is more insidious: by perfecting emotional manipulation, the conglomerate gains control over cognition itself. The ability to overwrite experiences and elicit specific emotional reactions gives them unprecedented power over human behavior, turning individuals into programmable assets for corporate and governmental interests.

## The Experiment: The Maze
The player is a volunteer who believes they have won a prestigious competition, granting them access to a highly confidential AI research program. Upon arrival, they are injected with an implant that disables their real memories and allows the implantation of synthetic experiences. Each time they pass through a gate in the maze, they enter a dream-like sequence designed to elicit specific psychological reactions. After the response is recorded, the player falls asleep and wakes up in the next stage of the maze, continuing the cycle. 

The player receives cryptic hints that the truth lies at the center of the maze. However, reaching the center results in their memory being wiped, resetting the cycle. Outside of the facility, their memories are rewritten to reflect an ordinary workday, preventing any recollection of their participation in the experiment. Over the course of a year, the player unknowingly undergoes the process countless times, generating massive amounts of data for the company.

### **The Emotional Valence of the Maze**
Each layer of the maze is constructed around a different emotional or psychological state—despair, nostalgia, paranoia, euphoria, grief. The memory injections are carefully curated to push the player into extreme emotions, ensuring raw and unfiltered data for AI training. The transitions between states are seamless, leaving the player uncertain about what is real. 

- **Euphoric Gate:** A scene filled with warmth, loved ones, and an overwhelming sense of purpose. The player experiences unshakable joy—only for it to be taken away as the next gate resets the environment.
- **Paranoia Gate:** A warped cityscape where figures watch from the shadows, and voices whisper from unseen places. The player is injected with the memory of being hunted.
- **Grief Gate:** The sudden loss of a fabricated loved one, forcing the player to experience an intense mourning period over someone they never knew.
- **Nostalgia Gate:** A place that feels eerily familiar, pulling at the edges of their subconscious. Could this be a fragment of their real past?

## Locations: Inside and Outside the Experiment
### **The Maze**
The maze is a vast, ever-shifting structure composed of sterile corridors, simulated environments, and towering walls that pulse with hidden technology. The deeper the player goes, the more dreamlike and unstable reality becomes. Each gate serves as a transition point, where memory injections take place. 

### **The Research Facility**
Outside the maze, the research facility appears to be a sleek, cutting-edge corporate environment. Employees believe they are working on a prestigious AI project, but only the highest-level personnel know the full extent of the memory experiments. The player's external life is fabricated, with coworkers, routines, and even relationships being artificially crafted to maintain the illusion of normalcy.

### **The City Beyond**
A sprawling metropolis governed by corporate technocrats. The city is hyper-connected, with neural interfaces, automated systems, and a population largely unaware of the conglomerate’s deeper experiments. While some underground factions resist corporate control, their influence is minimal, as memory-altering technology ensures widespread compliance.

## Disrupting the System: The Friend’s Intervention
A long-lost friend, aware of the player’s predicament, manages to hack into the testing system. They insert a hidden message into the maze, urging the player to escape. As the player progresses, the friend temporarily disables the implant at certain gates, allowing glimpses of real memories to surface. These flashes reveal crucial clues about the player’s identity and the true nature of the experiment.

The friend operates from a hidden location, likely an abandoned research lab or a resistance hideout in the city, where they have access to remnants of lost technology that allows them to interfere with the maze's systems. Their success is limited—they can only disable the implant for short periods before the system overrides their interference.

## Themes and Inspirations
- **Existential Identity:** What happens when one's sense of self is constantly rewritten?
- **Surreal and Dreamlike Atmosphere:** Influenced by *Inception*’s layered realities and the eerie crypticness of *Severance*.
- **Illusion and Emotional Manipulation:** Inspired by *Magnetic Rose*, where love, loss, and deception intertwine within an artificial world.
- **Corporate Dystopia:** A society where emotional experiences can be owned, bought, and weaponized.

## Possible Expansions
- **Memory Fragment System:** As the implant falters, the player sees scattered glimpses of the truth, forming an incomplete but growing picture of reality.
- **Other Subjects in the Maze:** Are they real, AI simulations, or echoes of past experiments?
- **Endings:** Multiple outcomes depending on how much of the truth the player uncovers and whether they can truly escape.

## Questions to Explore
- If memories define identity, who is the player once their real memories return?
- Is the AI being trained to be more human, or is humanity being rewritten to become more AI-like?
- Can the player break free, or are they trapped in an infinite loop?
